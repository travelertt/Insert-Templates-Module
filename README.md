# Insert Templates Module
This module provides a UI for inserting templates into textfields for complex markup in Drupal. Users can create additional templates.

## Idea

The idea for this module is a UI on the node form over the body field. It contains a menu of icons that represent different markup templates that have been precreated. These templates work like Macros and have little nothing to do with Drupal Theme .tpl files. These "Templates" are more complex markup for creating effects like scene on Apple product "Showcase" pages. This allows content creators and editors to "theme" out complexe pages without having to know markup, or allow them to save their complex markup for later use.
